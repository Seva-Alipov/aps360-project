# RISC V - C Disassembler

This project is a an AI powered disassembler, meaning it translates assembly to human-readable C code. Here, as a proof of concept, I will only be analysing RISC V assembly, and outputting C code.

In this repository you will find all the tools I use to obtain my data set, as well as the program code and anything else I may use. Notably absent is the training data, though sources for all code taken will be cited everywhere where appropriate.
